# Pricing Data Notes

## Why Portfolio Values May Differ from DEGIRO

You may notice that the portfolio value shown in this application differs from what DEGIRO shows. This is **normal and expected** for the following reasons:

### 1. **Timing Difference**
- **DEGIRO**: Shows real-time intraday prices (current market price)
- **This App**: Shows end-of-day closing prices (previous trading day)
- **Impact**: 1-3 day delay in price updates

**Example:**
- DEGIRO (Jan 12, 10:00 AM): EUR 168,692 (live prices)
- This App (Jan 12, 10:00 AM): EUR 217,626 (using Jan 9 closing prices)

### 2. **Price Volatility**
Your portfolio contains volatile defense/aerospace stocks:
- Rheinmetall AG
- SAAB AB
- Leonardo SPA
- Airbus Group

These stocks can move 5-10% in a single day, causing large swings in portfolio value.

### 3. **Price Type Differences**
- **DEGIRO**: May show mid-price (between bid/ask)
- **Yahoo Finance**: Shows closing price (last trade of the day)
- **Impact**: Small differences even on the same date

### 4. **Currency Conversion**
For USD-denominated stocks (AERCAP):
- **DEGIRO**: Uses real-time EUR/USD exchange rate
- **This App**: Uses historical rates from your transactions (avg: 1.0781 USD/EUR)
- **Impact**: Can cause differences in EUR-equivalent values

## What's Normal?

**Normal differences:**
- ✅ 1-3 day lag in prices (we show yesterday's close)
- ✅ Small differences (1-5%) due to timing and price type
- ✅ Different values between updates

**Concerning differences:**
- ❌ More than 10% difference for the same date
- ❌ Wrong stock quantities
- ❌ Missing stocks or transactions

## How to Minimize Differences

### Option 1: Update Prices Regularly (Recommended)

Click the **"📈 Update Market Data"** button daily to get the latest closing prices:

```bash
# Or via CLI
uv run invoke fetch-prices
```

### Option 2: Accept End-of-Day Prices

For long-term portfolio tracking, end-of-day prices are perfectly adequate. You don't need real-time data to track your portfolio performance over weeks and months.

### Option 3: Upgrade to Paid API (Not Recommended)

Paid APIs (Alpha Vantage, Twelve Data Pro, etc.) offer real-time or near-real-time data, but:
- ❌ Cost $9-50/month
- ❌ May still not match DEGIRO exactly (different data sources)
- ❌ Overkill for portfolio tracking

## Data Provider: Yahoo Finance

This application uses **Yahoo Finance** as the default data provider because:

✅ **Best for European stocks**
- Full coverage of Stockholm, Frankfurt, Milan, Paris, Amsterdam exchanges
- All your defense/aerospace stocks available
- No API key required

✅ **Free and reliable**
- No rate limits
- Good historical data
- Widely used and tested

⚠️ **Limitations**
- End-of-day prices only (no intraday)
- Unofficial API (web scraping)
- Occasional missing data or errors

## Expected Behavior

### Scenario: Fresh Upload

1. **Upload transactions** - Prices fetched automatically
2. **View portfolio** - Shows values using latest available closing prices
3. **Compare to DEGIRO** - May differ due to timing (see above)
4. **Next day** - Click "Update Market Data" to refresh

### Scenario: Daily Tracking

1. **Morning** - Your portfolio shows yesterday's closing prices
2. **DEGIRO** - Shows real-time prices (different values)
3. **Evening** - Click "Update Market Data"
4. **Result** - Portfolio updates to today's closing prices
5. **Tomorrow morning** - Values closer to DEGIRO's current prices
